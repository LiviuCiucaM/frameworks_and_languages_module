Server Framework Features
-------------------------

### (Flask roue example)

Web applications use a routing technique which is a mechanism that the HTTP methods and URLs are routed to a specific function within the code to handle it. For example we can bind the `route /`hello to the `helloWorld()` function in the flask application as bellow and the output of that function will be shown in your browser which is "Hello World!". Similarly you can add parameters to the url path (route):

``` python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/hello")
def hello_world():
    return "<p>Hello, World!</p>"
```

This is especially useful to give a meaningful url to the web application and to the pages within the web app and what the app should do/display when a user visit a certain page.
